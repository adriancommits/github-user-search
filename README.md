# Github User Search 

https://github-user-browser.netlify.com/

I built this app to play around with Github's REST API and the React Context API. 
- A search that queries Github's user database
- Detail pages that show the most important information about the user
- Overview of a user's repos and the basic metrics like followers, following and the number of public repos
